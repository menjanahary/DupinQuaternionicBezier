# DupinQuaternionicBezier
DupinQuaternionicBezier is a Grasshopper plugin for designing Dupin cyclidic splines based on Quaternionic Bezier Representation -- see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1524070315000272.
It contains 25 components including basic operations with quaternions, quaternionic Bezier representation of circular arcs, Dupin cyclide principal patches (DCPP), hybrid patches made of two DCPPs, performed offset operation  and meshing of DCPPs.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for Rhino 7

STEP 1. Unzip the DupinQuaternionicBezier.zip file. (Make sure you actually unzip the file, do not just drag the DupinQuaternionicBezier.gha out of the zip file viewer).

STEP 2. Do not install the DupinQuaternionicBezier.gha in more than one Rhino version. 

STEP 3. Open Grasshopper in Rhino 7 WIP and go to File > Special Folders > Components Folder.

STEP 4. Place the DupinQuaternionicBezier.gha file in that Libraries folder.

STEP 5. Completely close both Grasshopper and Rhino fully. 

STEP 6. Launch Rhino, then Grasshopper, you should now have a DupinQuaternionicBezier tab in Grasshopper.

Remark: I myself did not try to install DupinQuaternionicBezier.gha in other versions of Rhino.
